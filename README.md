Hello Everyone, This was my first ever python project, I made KBC game with questions and answers with bonus over every correct answer made it using switch case sattements. Over time I added text to speech interface as well which will read you questions and tell about your answer is correct or not.
Hope So you will enjoy playing. Give it a shot!
Thanks

Hello Everyone, my second project using python that was encryption and decryption. This code will prompt you to add input and will translate that input into 
encrypted format, no one other than decryptor can understand that. 
Better Give it a shot once!
